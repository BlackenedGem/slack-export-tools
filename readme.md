# slack-export-tools

**Deprecated**

This utility was designed to help analyse the json in a slack archive export.
This involves converting it to more human readable formats, as well as generating statistics and lists.  

It evolved over a long time as I was figuring out the slack API. Additionally the API has changed over time and due to the architecture this has gotten harder to handle. Some features that used to work have either been bodge fixed occasionally (as I still use this) or dropped. Because of this I'm rewriting this as ![slack-tools](https://github.com/hollyroberts/slack-tools) but progress has been slow due to real life.
